🌍 Welcome to My GIS & Data Adventures! 🚀
Hey there! I’m Melanie, a GIS and geodata enthusiast who loves digging into maps, crunching data, and finding hidden patterns in the world around us. Whether it’s mapping out flight paths, analyzing urban heat islands, or just figuring out how people move, I’m all about turning raw data into cool, interactive stories.

A Bit About Me:
🗺️ GIS Explorer: ArcGIS, QGIS—you name it! I love working with maps and geographic data, turning them into insights that tell a story.
📊 Data Detective: SQL, Python (hello, pandas and geopandas!) are my go-to tools for unraveling complex datasets and making them speak.
🎨 Visualization Nerd: Whether it’s building dashboards in Tableau or whipping up a Python heatmap, I’m all about making data look as good as it works.
👥 Cohort Whisperer: Obsessed with finding trends in user behavior—especially when it comes to travel, flight data, and cool geospatial insights.
